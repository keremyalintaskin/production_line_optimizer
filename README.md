# production_line_optimizer
This project solves a production line scheduling problem where `n` sequential jobs must be assigned to `m` different machines. Each job takes a different amount of time on each machine, and switching machines between jobs incurs a transition cost. The goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all jobs in order.
